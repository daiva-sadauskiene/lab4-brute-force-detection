# Lab 4: Brute Force Attack Investigation & IP Block via Microsoft Defender

This lab documents a real brute-force login attempt detected on my Azure VM on July 25, 2025. Using Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Endpoint, I investigated the incident, identified the malicious IP address, and blocked it via custom indicator. This exercise helped reinforce incident response workflows: detection â†’ investigation â†’ mitigation.

## Steps Overview
### 1. Detection and Alert:
- Created a custom analytics rule in Sentinel to detect multiple failed login attempts.
- Linked VM logs to Sentinel via Log Analytics Workspace.
- Received email alert from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on **July 25, 2025**.

### 2. Investigation in Sentinel and Defender:
- Investigated the incident: entity details, IPs, login attempts.
- Queried SecurityEvent table for Event ID 4625 (failed login)
- Found multiple failed login attempts from IP 77.223.102.227
- Validated that the alert was triggered by a real attack.

### 3. IP Origin:
The IP address `77.223.102.227` was identified in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint by reviewing the alert and incident details.  
It was confirmed via Microsoft Sentinel by querying failed login logs (Event ID 4625).  
Geolocation analysis showed the IP originates from Russia (Selectel network).

### 4. Defender for Endpoint Response:
- Opened the incident in Microsoft Defender security portal
- From there, navigated to the related alert
- Added the attacker IP as a custom network indicator and set it to "Block"

*Indicator configured to block the IP, with description referencing brute-force attempts.*

### 5. Verification of IP Block

- After adding the IP as a custom network indicator in Microsoft Defender, I verified its effectiveness by running a Kusto query in Sentinel to search for any further failed login attempts from the same IP.
- The query returned no results, confirming that the IP was successfully blocked.

*Kusto query filtering failed login attempts by the malicious IP after indicator was set to block.*
